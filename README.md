🍴 ChaatBites is a repository developed as part of Chowgule's webathon, a 7-hour hackathon aimed at solving problems commonly faced by restaurants, such as difficulties with ordering, online visibility, and parking.

🔍 Our solution included a variety of features to address these problems, such as:

* 🌐 Designing an SEO-optimized landing page to improve the restaurant's online visibility
* 📝 Implementing a menu and cart ordering system for customer convenience
* 🧑‍💼 Creating an admin page for updating parking lot information and adding new items to the menu
* 🤖 Incorporating machine learning-based recommendation and authentication systems to enhance the user experience

🎉 As a result of our efforts, we were recognized as runners-up in the competition. It was a great opportunity to showcase our expertise and collaborate on the rapid development of an innovative web application.
